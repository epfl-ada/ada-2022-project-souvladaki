# Common sense on Wikipedia links position
This is the proposal of our ADA project, in which we are working on the Wikispeedia dataset. For this milestone we provide:
- This README as our official project proposal
- The initial_analysis.ipynb which contains some initial analysis steps for the dataset.

## Abstract 


## Research Questions


## Methods


## Proposed Timeline


## Internal Milestones


## Libraries and Implementation
The project will be implemented in Python, using the following packages.
* Pandas and Numpy: For data analysis
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizations
* Networkx: For graph analytics
* BeatifulSoup: For HTML page analysis


## Related Work
There has been related projects about studying the HTML structure (see [References](#References)) of Wikipedia pages, in order to determine the position of the links that users are most likely to follow. Our proposal is different from this work, as the aforementioned studies analysize the structure of the page with users that are just traversing the data of Wikipedia website, thus the links they follow are the ones that they find "interesting" in general. In our work, we analyze the clicks that users did based on their target article, thus providing more insight about the connections they form between articles. An interesting comparison at our final step would be to compare the results from the analysis of the corresponding literature and study if there are differences in the observations. For example, literature claims that users tend to click articles on the left side of the page, when browsing Wikipedia pages. We can compare if this behavior still remains when the users have a target article.
